## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
Installation of Python 3, Numpy, Pandas Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit learn libraries are sufficient to run the codes in the notebook. 

## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>
For this project, I was interested in building a regression model to predict selling price of cars in Kaggle's Car dataset and also find answers to the following questions:
1. Which features of a car has the most impact on the price of the car?
2. Does the distance covered by the cars before sale affect the price of cars?
3. Which is most expensive, diesel or petrol cars?
4. Which car brands are the most expensive?
5. Which gear transmission type is most expensive, automatic or manual?
5. Does age of cars from first purchase affect the selling price?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
There is one note book file that contains the exploratory data analysis and model building. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the process for individual steps.


## Results <a name="results"></a>
These are the main findings and answers to the qustions.
1. From the correlation plot, engine capacity had the most correlation with the price of the cars.
2. No. Analysis revealed that the distance covered by the car after first purchase had insignificant impact on the price of the cars.
3. Diesel cars out paced petrol cars with a largr margin as more expensive as 90 of the top 100 most expensive cars were Diesel run.
4. My analysis showed that BMW brands were the most expensive in the dataset having the highest number of cars in the top 100 most expensive cars.
5. Automatic cars were more expensive than manual cars with 94 of the top 100 expensive cars being automatic gear.
6. From my analysis, the age of cars i.e from first purchase till date, had insigniificant impact on the price of the cars.
